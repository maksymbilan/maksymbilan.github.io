<p align='center'>So where are you? It's been a little while<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Lovin' what I'm tastin'<br>
Venom on my tongue<br>
Dependant at times<br>
Poisonous vibration<br>
Help my body run<br>
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fev<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Fall out of formation<br>
I plan my escape from walls they confined<br>
Rebel red carnation<br>
Grows while I decay<br>
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
Had you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red<br>
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head<br>
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead<br>
The last two lines may read incorrect until said<br>
The lead is terrible in flavor<br>
But now you double as a papermaker<br>
I despise you sometimes<br>
I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Beat is a chemical, yeah<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Moment is medical, yeah<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Beat is a chemical, yeah<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Moment is medical, yeah<br>
I'm so sorry, I forgot you<br>
Let me catch you up to speed<br>
I've been tested like the ends of<br>
A weathered flag that's by the sea<br>
Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
I'm just a chemical<br>
Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
I'm just a chemical<br>
Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
I'm just a chemical<br>
Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
I'm just a chemical</p>
